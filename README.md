    <h3>Projects and Work</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Spatial Spillover Effect of Land Development Program on Nearby Home Values</strong>: This study evaluates the impact of the Columbus, OH land bank program on neighboring housing prices since 2010 using a hedonic model. It investigates the effects of land bank acquisitions and redevelopment (garden vs. non-garden) on nearby property values at varying time scales and distances. The findings show a positive long-term spillover effect and a preference for open spaces, highlighting the land bank program's role in stabilizing neighborhoods and enhancing property values in urban areas.</li>
      
      <li><strong>The Impact of WWII Bombings on Urban Redevelopment: A Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Residential Properties in Vienna, Austria</strong>: This study examines the long-term effects of WWII bombings on urban redevelopment and property ownership in Vienna, Austria. Using parcel-level data and nearest neighbor matching, we assess the impact of bombing on building height, ownership patterns, and private ownership. The findings reveal significant post-war increases in building height, fragmented ownership, and private ownership in bombed areas. Additionally, we explore redevelopment trends using building permits, uncovering a relationship between bombing, property characteristics, and redevelopment dynamics.</li>
      
      <li><strong>The Impact of Land Bank Programs on Neighborhood Foreclosure Risks: Evidence from Columbus, Ohio Using a Discrete-Time Duration Model</strong>: This study uses a discrete-time duration model to evaluate the impact of land bank acquisitions on foreclosure risk in Columbus, Ohio. Findings show that land bank interventions reduce foreclosure likelihood in the short term, particularly for nearby properties, though the effect diminishes over time and distance. Housing characteristics like price, property age, and loan-to-value ratios also influence outcomes. The study underscores the importance of land banks in neighborhood stabilization and highlights the need for sustained interventions to support long-term recovery.</li>
